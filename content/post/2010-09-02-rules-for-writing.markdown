While browsing aimlessly, I happened upon an article on The Guardian on [rules for writing](https://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/ten-rules-for-writing-fiction-part-one).
I was completely taken with Elmore Leonard's advice. Some excerpts:



<blockquote>3 Never use a verb other than "said" to carry dialogue [...]</blockquote>




<blockquote>4 Never use an adverb to modify the verb "said" [...]</blockquote>




<blockquote>5 Keep your exclamation points under control [...]</blockquote>




<blockquote>8 Avoid detailed descriptions of characters [...]</blockquote>



My thoughts exactly. I'm going to have to read this guy.
