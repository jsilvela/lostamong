I've arrived in what is, apparently, the worst winter in many years. My journey from Seattle was delayed several hours due to a snowstorm across Europe, which left a 20cm snowfall in Luxembourg, the largest in 20 years.
And it has snowed almost every day since then. I'm growing tired of this, and look forward to the traditional Luxembourgish rain with grey sky.

Christmas market, after warning of severe weather:

The eerie trees are now familiar, and not eerie at all:
