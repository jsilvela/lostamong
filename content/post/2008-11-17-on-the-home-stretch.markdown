I love this time of the year. The gray skies, the crisp air, the warmth of bed.

Next weekend I'm going to New York, where I'll be spending the week of Thanksgiving. I haven't been there since February. Then, Christmas and New Year in Madrid. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, work should be a bit less stressful than it has been in the last months. The year is winding down, and it's been a busy one, closing shop in New York and moving to Seattle, with the Nepal trip in between.

I've always liked the season. It's not as beautiful as October, but there's a special energy. It has become especially important since moving to the US. Going home on or around Christmas is necessary for my sanity.
