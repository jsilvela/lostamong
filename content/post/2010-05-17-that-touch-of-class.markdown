This weekend, my old landlord, Greg, had a farewell gathering at my (his) old apartment before it gets sold. I was curious to see what the decorators had done with it: in this area, apartments are shown furnished to make them more appealing, even if they are not meant to be sold furnished. A designer or decorator, or someone with certified "good taste", makes the arrangements.

Greg, on greeting me, told me that some of the decorator's choices were not necessarily his own.
I am of the same opinion:

And I didn't take a picture of the fake animal fur rugs and African vases in the living room!
