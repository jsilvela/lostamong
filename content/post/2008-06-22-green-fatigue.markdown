It goes like this:

> (someone) I see you drive a Prius, that's great!
>
> (me) Thanks!
>
> You will find that people in Seattle are very concerned with the environment, unlike in other places.
>
> I found there was a high degree of environmentalism in New York.
>
> Oh, really?

And sometimes I read stupid things like these:




  * You should never eat meat, and become a vegetarian. Do it for the environment.


  * Bottled water is evil. Filtered tap water tastes great, anyway.


  * The problem is India and China becoming wealthier. We must tutor them.

  * Don't eat mammals, they have souls. Mollusks are OK, they're too small to have souls.




The last item comes from Michael Pollan's famous _Omnivore's Dilemma_ - yes, really.
I like to think I'm pretty green, but I'm getting tired of all the sanctimony I get fed. I will continue to eat red meat. I will continue to eat fish. I tried the water filter, and Seattle tap water still tastes nasty. I don't know why nobody worries about plants's souls, or killing plants. And I continue to be surprised that over-population is rarely mentioned as an environmental threat.

Here is a cartoon from the wonderful [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) that got a laugh out of me:
