Washington State is known as the Evergreen State, and for good reason. A lot of the trees in this area are perennials, so the fall here isn't as defined as in the East Coast. Some of the leaves are turning, though, and the Japanese maples are very bright these days, so here are a few photos. Most of them taken with my new SLR camera, the Canon EOS T2i, which I bought myself as a gift for having been a good boy lately.
