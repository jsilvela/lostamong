The third try was the charm. On previous weekends, I hadn't been able to climb up Mailbox Peak. This time, JP and I met in North Bend in the morning, and reached the top by lunch time. It was four hours round-trip. The inclination is impressive: 4000 ft (1200 m) of elevation gained in the space of 2.5 miles (4 km). Surprisingly, there was a trail all the way, and we didn't need to use our hands.

At the top of the peak, there are two mailboxes. People put things in them, and apparently, letters have been delivered from there!
