The last few months I've read about a couple of ideas that I found interesting.

Michael Sandel argues that
[meritocracy has a dark side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qewckuxa9hw):
If all doors are open to
you, but you're poor, it's your fault. The center-left parties, in their embrace
of meritocracy, have left behind the working class electorate they used to cater
to.

I've read some arguments around these points before, but Sandel is the first I've
heard that sees meritocracy itself as the problem, so clearly. In his TED Talk he
argues for re-attaching dignity to labor. I definitely agree, though I don't see
why meritocracy is necessarily at odds with dignified labor. Sandel has a book
out that I imagine will offer more nuance.

[Peter Turchin](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/)
has coined the term *elite overproduction*. There is a new demographic
of people with all the right credentials who have not made it to the elite.
This [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/0bf03db8-c61b-4222-8c76-4fb23988ec13)
argues that the new Ã©lite manquÃ©e clarifies both Brexit and Trumpism.
The alliance of the ignored working class with the resentful sub-elites who 
want their turn at the top.

The article holds that the current brand of right-wing populism can't last long. Once
the populists are in power, they find it is not possible to govern in favor of
both the working class and the sub-elites.

But in this little post I don't want to delve more into the political points.
Rather, I want to comment on behavior I've seen close at hand, from the vantage
point of meritocratic hubris and elite overproduction.

A few years ago, a childhood friend of mine protested loudly on social media
that he had seen a job offer for a plumber, and the salary was higher than what
he was making, with his electrical engineering degree. He declared that Spain
was a shitty country. I suppose the implication was that in a proper country,
he'd make more money than a plumber.

This reminds me of the adage that in the
current brand of capitalism, profit is private, but losses are socialized. You
just know that these people who blame their country for not giving them the job
they deserve, would find the merit entirely their own if they were to become
successful.

Every now and then, some wannabe-elite person, say, a journalist who hasn't made
it, complains publicly that a cashier may have a similar or higher salary, or
better contractual conditions. I wonder if these people would be happier if the
cashiers had a lower salary, because then they could tell themselves they're
elite.

A few years ago there was a debate in Spain around unpaid internships, after it
was reported that most of the highest rated restaurants in Spain depended on unpaid
interns. \
One side of the debate held that this was fine. Invaluable experience
for those interns. Lessons in life, etc. The other side protested that
unpaid internships excluded people who needed to support themselves. If the only
way into an industry is via unpaid internships, then only rich kids can get in.\
For their part, many of the restaurateurs protested that without unpaid labor,
their restaurants were not viable.

One has to wonder about that situation. Highly rated restaurants are being
subsidized by the families of the unpaid interns. And for those families, it is
probably a source of pride to declare that one of the children is working at *El
Bulli* or whatever. Much better than getting an actual salary for work in a
lesser known restaurant. Or on some other sustainable venture.

In a more humorous note, I've heard that as skiing is taken up by more and
more middle class families, there is much chagrin among the families who were
"already skiing in the eighties".

Leave it to South Park to write a song for this, in their
[*Pee* episode.](https://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/xenush/south-park-pee-season-13-ep-14 )
