Mom and dad were here last week; their first visit to Seattle, or the West Coast in general. Parental visits are the time I usually take things a bit easier. Luckily, a period of extreme busyness at work had just come to an end, so I was able to relax this time around too.

Most of the time I feel I should be doing something more. I should be learning a new subject, trying to meet more people, tidying my papers, cleaning the house, or any number of things that I tend to postpone. I'm often frustrated in this respect.

Visits give my time a new purpose. My objective during visits is to get out of work as early as I can, and enjoy the company. My parents are not in the least interested in doing tourism, so I don't have to make an effort. One evening we drove to my office from Seattle, because it's a nice drive over lake Washington, and another evening we went to Discovery Park. The rest of the time they explored on their own while I was at work. And that was that.

Now I'm again racing against time. Autumn is the one season of the year where I tend to win this race.
