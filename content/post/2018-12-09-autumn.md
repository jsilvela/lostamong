The strawberry tree flowered at lastâ€”its first flowering.

I notice now that many plants flower in autumn. That must mean that there are insects
around to pollinate them. In my own garden, some bees are now busy around the ivy.

It is the time of the year to do a bit of pruning. Every year I have to cut down a
small tree that wants to grow right on my fence. It's coming from a neighbor's tree
and it is quite invasive. I've noticed that the trunk has grown around the wiring.
I respect that.

The muted colors and the cloudy skies encourage me to go out with my camera:
