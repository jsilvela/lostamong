It's been over a month now since I left the Seattle apartment with the spectacular view. I can't say I don't miss it at all, but, as I thought would happen, being able to walk to work is more than adequate compensation, and there are other advantages to the new place. More than anything, what I miss about the old place is how it impressed my guests.

For daily living, all I need is a window where I can see some sky. Trees are welcome too.
