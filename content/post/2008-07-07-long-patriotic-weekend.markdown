I wish all weekends were this long. I had Friday off since it was the 4th of July. To celebrate, in the evening Emily came to my place with her friend Christina. I hadn't seen Emily since Andrea's wedding a month ago, so it was great to catch up.

We mainly had cheese, ice-cream and berries with white wine. I had made sangr√≠a, as we were expecting a couple of people more, but we ended up not having any. We sat in the deck watching the fireworks in Belltown and Gasworks, a park on the North end of Lake Union. Lake Union itself was crowded with people out on their boats. Seems like a good way to celebrate Independence Day.

After the fireworks it was getting chilly, so we went inside and chatted. It was nice to do something so easy, and it's a luxury to have an apartment in such a strategic location.
The rest of the weekend I've just relaxed and caught up with sleep.
Aaaaaah, I wish I had more days.
