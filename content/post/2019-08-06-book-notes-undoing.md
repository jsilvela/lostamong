Not meant as a review, just as a repository of paragraphs I liked.\
Yes, I did like the book.

page 71: 

> “I’ve always felt that ideas are a dime a dozen,” he said. “If you had one
> that didn’t work out, you should not fight too hard to save it, just go find
> another”

page 81:

> … He’d been asked to divine the character of the nation’s youth. Instead he’d
> found out something about people who try to divine other people’s character:
> Remove their gut feeling, and their judgment is improved.

page 81:

> … “The difference between Danny and the the next 999,999 psychologists is his
> ability to find the phenomenon and then explain it in a way that applies to
> other situations.” … “It looks like luck, but he keeps doing it.”

page 139:

> But to Danny, useful advice, however obvious, was better than no advice at
> all. He asked his students to figure out what advice they would give to an
> Egyptologist who was having difficulty deciphering a hieroglyph. “He tells us
> that the guy is going slower and slower and getting more and more stuck,”
> recalled Daniela Gordon, a student who became a researcher at the Israeli
> army. “Then Danny asks ‘What should he do?’ No one could think of anything.
> And Danny says; “He should take a nap!’”

page 205:

> In his talk to historians, Amos described their occupational hazard: the
> tendency to take whatever facts they had observed (neglecting many facts that
> they did not or could not observe) and make them fit neatly into a
> confident-sounding story: “All too often, we find ourselves unable to predict
> what will happen; yet after the fact we explain what did happen with a great
> deal of confidence. This ‘ability’ to explain that which we cannot predict,
> even in the absence of any additional information, represents an important,
> though subtle, flaw in our reasoning”

page 227:

> in treating individual patients, the doctors behaved differently than they did
> when they designed treatments for groups of patients with the same symptoms.
> They were likely to order additional tests to avoid raising troubling issues,
> and less likely to ask if patients wished to donate their organs if they
> died. In treating individual patients, doctors often did things they would
> disagree with if they were creating public policy to to treat groups of
> patients with the exact same illness.

page 228:

> “The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You
> waste years by not being able to waste hours”

page 259:

> “When they made decisions, people did not seek to maximize utility. They
> sought to minimize regret.”

page 332:

> After all, what is a marriage if not an agreement to distort one’s perception
> of another , in relation to everyone else?

page 343:

> The surprise was that their usage of the greater Toronto health care system
> declined. When homeless people felt taken care of by a hospital, they didn’t
> look for other hospitals that might take care of them. The homeless said,
> “That was the best that can be done for me.” The entire Toronto  health care
> system had been paying a price for its attitude to the homeless.
