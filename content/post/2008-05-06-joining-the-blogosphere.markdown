Ah, my selfless motives to join: it was already difficult to keep my friends and family in Madrid well informed, but now that I have left New York to go to Seattle, I have so many more people to give updates to! I find myself writing the same things, more or less, in many different emails.


In one of those strange actions that are meant to be lazy but will probably entail lots of work, I've decided to start this blog. Next time someone asks "so how's it going in Seattle?" I can point here, maybe.




Enjoy, or don't. Up to you!
