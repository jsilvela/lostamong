This weekend I ran a 12km race through the city of Luxembourg. Last race I had been in was a 10km in New York, back in 2007. It was fun to do it again, and I was happy that I felt great, and found a good rhythm.

It was really not a serious race, more of a celebration in the city. Every so often, the race would stop as the runners had to climb up or down stairs. On narrow portions of the track, a pair of friends would be running side by side. Onlookers would cross the path at any point.
But once I got used to that, it was just fine.

I was number 89, out of 308 in my age group. Pretty happy about finishing the race, and finishing in a good way.
