I generally do not to write about work in this blog, but it is the first time
that I can point to some publicly available software to which I have
contributed.

If you catch any news on [Bing](http://www.bing.com): that's the group I work
in.

As to my personal contribution: it reminds me a bit of that scene in
_The Ten Commandments_ where Charlton Heston is building a monument city for his
father, and watches an obelisk fall into place, then says:

> Put a thousand slaves to clear the sand off the base of the obelisk

By which I mean I'm one of the slaves removing the sand, not Charlton Heston.
