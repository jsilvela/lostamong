At last, I got around to sending the negatives from my trip to New Zealand in 2003 to be re-scanned. As happened with the [Grand Canyon photos]({{<relref "2008-12-06-grand-canyon-remastered.markdown">}}), the re-scans are a substantial improvement over what I had. The colors are looking more realistic, and dark exposures are respected. It is easier to realize, now, that a given shot was taken at dawn or in bad weather.

You can take a look at the [full album on my SmugMug page](http://jsilvela.smugmug.com/gallery/8833689_Ms4Rv/1/585298222_8hmyh), but here is a selection of some favorites (you can click on the photos to enlarge):
