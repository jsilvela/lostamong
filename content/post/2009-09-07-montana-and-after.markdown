The trip to Glacier NP, Montana, happened a week ago. It's about time I posted
the [photo album](https://jsilvela.smugmug.com/Travel/Hikes/Glacier-NP-MT/9489675_qdWXq).

Since it feels far away now, I'm not doing a write-up. Know that it was a good,
intense hike, and that each of us sustained some physical damage, as happens in
intense hikes. We all returned to Seattle in one piece - one piece per person,
that is.

Now I'm in Madrid, enjoying idleness and mom's cooking.
