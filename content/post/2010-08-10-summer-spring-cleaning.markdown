I spent this weekend tidying up all my papers. The new apartment had been presentable for a while already, but I had an unpleasant feeling about my mountain of papers, which had been growing over the years.

I started working Saturday morning. Opening all my unopened bank statements, rounding up all the warranties that had expired, the instruction manuals for things I had no longer, the loose receipts that were relevant.

Before I knew it, three hours had passed, and I had started to develop a back pain. But this was exciting, the end was in sight, and I kept going with manic energy. At about 8:30 I declared victory and lay on my back to ease the pain. On Sunday I bought some extra envelopes and organizers, and now everything is accounted for, and takes a third of the space. And it's out of sight, in the closet. Ahhh!

Impressive: about 10 hours of work. I never again want to go through this for paperwork.
