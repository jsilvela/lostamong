This is the first post I write using my new workflow for the blog.
I've been growing more and more dissatisfied with WordPress, which forces
its own idiosyncracies on blog layout, typography and storage.

Last year a friend of mine asked me for help with her WP site. She was doing
some fancy layout, and her site wasnâ€™t quite working. I had to wade into
the guts of it, and found the whole thing unbelievably messy.

A blog is a simple site and should be simple to write and host.
This new incarnation of Lost Among Europeans (was Americans) is certainly simple
to host and write.

One piece of functionality is no longer available: comments. Sorry, mom.
