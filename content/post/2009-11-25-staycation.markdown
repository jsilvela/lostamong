I like this American word. It means a vacation where you stay home. Tomorrow, my Thanksgiving holidays begin. I got tomorrow off in exchange for having worked on Sunday a few weeks ago. Thursday and Friday are off pretty much everywhere in the US.
I am not going to do anything for five days. I invited a friend over for Thanksgiving day, to listen to music. I won't cook.
My five days off will be as irrelevant as possible.
