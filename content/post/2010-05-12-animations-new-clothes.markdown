Finally I managed to watch The _Fantastic Mr. Fox_, which, together with _Ponyo_ and _Up_, seems to have been one of the great animation films of the past year. It was the one I hadn't yet seen. The three of them have received almost universal acclaim, and [tomatometer](https://www.rottentomatoes.com) scores above 90%, a rare thing. And yet, all three have disappointed me.

[_Up_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/) was very hard to watch whole. After a nice beginning, it went the way all Disney movies seem to go lately: it became a chase movie. The chase, as of late, has become to Disney movies what  gratuitous watered-down sex scenes were to the dramas of the nineties.
The chase in _Up_ is so exhausting that the villain makes Glenn Close in _Fatal Attraction_ seem pusillanimous.

[_The Fantastic Mr. Fox_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/) is much more imaginative, and quite interesting. But I find clay-mation hard to watch. The constant irregularity of the figurines is very distracting to my eyes; exhausting. Many of the jokes are self references to Wes Anderson's type of film. What would happen if Max, from _Rushmore_, were a clay figurine? I find Mr. Fox more an exercise in cineculture than a film to enjoy on its own.

[_Ponyo_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0876563/) I have liked better than the recent Miyazaki films. It's not as overtly metaphoric and moralistic, closer to _My Neighbor Totoro_ than to _Spirited Away_. The artwork is some of the most beautiful I've seen recently, and seems to be made of the stuff of dreams. The weak point for Miyazaki is narrative rhythm. After a very enjoyable beginning and middle, the film is resolved, unconvincingly, in a couple of minutes.
But Ponyo is, in my opinion, the best of these three.

What I don't quite understand is the universal acclaim. Granted, there are not so many good films each year, but I think animation is getting a lot of help from critics. It reminds me of a very good [review I read of the movie The Producers](https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/movies/16prod.html?_r=2&scp=29&sq=a.%20o.%20scott%20broadway&st=cse), adapted from the Broadway show: "Now, many big musicals represent the lowest common denominator: theme park attractions for tourists. The movie audience, I suspect, is more discriminating."

I think the same critical blindness toward musicals is affecting animation. Suddenly, every animation film that is not unbearable for adults is lauded as a pearl of art, beauty and wisdom. That screenplay, character development and rhythm are not demanded is a slap in the face to the animation films that are truly good. _South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut_, _The Jungle Book_, _Bambi_, _My Neighbor Totoro_, are as good as any film can be. No excuses.
