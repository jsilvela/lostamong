The web is a great and dangerous place for me. Its potential for discovery is
matched by its potential of addiction and time waste. I have my ups and downs
with these problems. Even during my ups, I struggle with the
sheer volume of information I
want to read, assimilate, and catalog for future reference.
A growing stack of links, references, books, sit waiting for me.

I have tried
different ways of of coping, but however sophisticated
a system I try, it can't work, because I bite off more than I can chew.

Another tendency has been growing in me: I write more and more. I've neglected
this particular blog for some time, but at work I keep documentation and
jot down explanations to designs.

I keep notes of half-baked ideas, sometimes of jokes I've
thought of that need some work. Perhaps, I'll take a few of them and try to make
something cohesive. I track my health in a text file.

I find all this soothing to write, but also, helpful.
The act of writing has often made me slow down and clarify my ideas.
Sometimes, I want to start off from a previous idea that I know I've written down,
and having that head start gives me a jolt of joy and motivates me to write more.

All this is to justify: I'm going to start keeping track of the material I read by
writing about it. I don't mean like a critic, concentrating on a piece in
particular, nor do I mean writing about everything I consume.
Rather, I may write
about articles, videos, books, ideas that have been in my mind recently. Why did
I suddenly become interested in this or that? What sparked my interest in this
topic, or this author? Things that a simple list of bookmarks fails to capture.

My hope is that, going back to my writings, the effect will be similar
to listening to some music one hasn't heard in a while, and will bring back a
context.

We'll see if that works.
