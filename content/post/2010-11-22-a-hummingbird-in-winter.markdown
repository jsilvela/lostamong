Today it snowed in Seattle; or I assume so, because it snowed in Bellevue:

It was a short flurry, not enough to blanket the ground. After lunch, I went for a walk, camera in hand, and caught a glimpse of a hummingbird when passing next to a flower garden. I saw it fly to a near tree, and I decided to wait still, next to the flower garden. After a couple of minutes, the hummingbird came back and started hovering over the flowers. I was able to catch it on High Definition (720p). I need to learn how to shoot video properly with this camera, but here goes (click on image to go to the video):

Was I lucky!
