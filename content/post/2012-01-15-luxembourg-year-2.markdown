How time flies. I don't have the feeling of a year having gone by in Europe, and yet so many things have happened. I suppose this means it's been going well.

So far, the first two weeks of the new year have brought hiking and some good sunsets. I'm glad I didn't listen to the Luxembourg naysayers. Now for more questing.
