At last, I got around to sending the negatives from my trip to New Zealand in 2003 to be re-scanned. As happened with the [Grand Canyon photos]({{< relref "/post/2008-12-06-grand-canyon-remastered.markdown" >}}), the re-scans are a substantial improvement over what I had. The colors are looking more realistic, and dark exposures are respected. It is easier to realize, now, that a given shot was taken at dawn or in bad weather.
