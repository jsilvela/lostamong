Ah, Interstellar. On one hand, I like seeing really ambitious movies, like they used to make decades ago. On the other, what is it with this new generation of prestige directors who are not satisfied with understandable plots, because, well, then they're too simple? Nolan, Aronofsky, M Night Shyamalan, Paul Thomas Anderson, they remind me of teenagers exposed to philosophy in school, drunken in narcissistic intellectual self-regard.

The plot twists from Interstellar remind me of this excerpt from a great South Park episode.
