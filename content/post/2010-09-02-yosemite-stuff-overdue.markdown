At last I got around to making videos and putting them on my website. What is two months among friends?

The photo albums:
[short(er) version](http://jsilvela.smugmug.com/Hikes/Yosemite-best-Guillermos/12849465_HPX6V#937987623_gxUyd)
[full-length](http://jsilvela.smugmug.com/Hikes/Yosemite-combined/12871500_JD8Tw#937987623_gxUyd).

The videos are in full definition and full length (the hike video is 20 min!). They may tax your browser or your connection. You can press the pause button so there's more cached footage when you press play.
