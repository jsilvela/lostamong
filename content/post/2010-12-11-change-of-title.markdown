You may have noticed the new blog title. I arrived in Luxembourg on Thursday night, after the biggest snowfall the country had seen in quite a while - I heard someone say 20 years. This is my new town, here is my new job. The adventure goes on.

It is too soon for me to have a coherent idea of what the past years in Seattle, and previously, in New York, have meant for me. I can say this though: a lot.

Now, the fun and annoying task of figuring out the basics of living here.
It's either that, or going back to bed.
