We've had some weeks of wonderful weather in Luxembourg, and in the evenings I feel like stepping out to the terrace. In my neck of town, there is often a bird show at dusk. There is a crane in one of the nearby blocks, on which the birds love to roost. They arrive in flocks and crowd the crane. Every now and then, a flock will go out for a flight around the neighborhood, then come back.
When the days start getting warmer, I'll sit on the terrace one day, watching, as long as it takes to make sense of things. I think I saw a documentary recently that stated that the purpose of the flock flights in the evenings is unknown.
