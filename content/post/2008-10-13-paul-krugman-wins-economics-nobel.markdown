He's almost the only reason I keep reading the New York Times. I find their other lead writers, like Friedman and Dowd, both sanctimonious and unimaginative. There is another writer I like, Dan Schnur, who worked for McCain's campaign in the previous election. Schnur, like Krugman, is willing to speak clearly, and ruffle feathers inside his own newspaper and readership.

I've bought five of Krugman's books, including his textbook on microeconomics (which I haven't yet read). He's a whistle blower, warning of America's economic and social maladies even at times when others say everything is Great. His last, _The Conscience of a Liberal_, was scathing.
I'm happy he won; I consider him my personal economist.

A couple of articles:
[Krugman on the "old" Paulson rescue plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/opinion/22krugman.html)
[Krugman on home ownership](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/opinion/23krugman.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss)
[Schnur on Deomcratic smugness](https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/right-fight-wrong-word/)
