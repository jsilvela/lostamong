I just watched the documentary _Food Inc._ I had been waiting for it a while. Years ago, I read Michael Pollan's famous _Omnivore's Dilemma_, and found it manipulative, though I appreciated the tremendous information it contained. You can read my [Amazon review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G24ACXLL77DT/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) for detail.
Pollan has a large role in the documentary, and I like his interviews, they're much more balanced than the book. The information in the documentary is not as abundant, and not as shocking, but shocking still for people who have not read articles or books about the American food system.

So, I do encourage you to watch _Food Inc._ It is dense with information, concerning, timely, at times repulsive, but also entertaining and optimistic.
